    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        # This action checks out the source code to the GitHub Actions runner environment

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment

        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'  # We're specifying Node.js version 16 for this project
        # Using Node.js 16 ensures that we have the correct runtime to install and run Cypress

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        # This step installs all the project dependencies defined in package.json, including Cypress

      # Step 4: Install Cypress binary (if not already installed)
      - name: Install Cypress
        run: npm install cypress --save-dev
        # Explicitly installing Cypress here, though it should already be in devDependencies

      # Step 5: Verify the installation of the Cypress binary
      - name: Verify Cypress binary installation
        run: npx cypress verify
        # This step checks if the Cypress binary is correctly installed and available to run tests

      # Step 6: Run Cypress tests
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npx cypress run --browser ${{ matrix.browser }}
        # Here, the tests are executed across the browsers specified in the matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
        # The `matrix.browser` will dynamically pass the browser name into the Cypress command for testing

        run: npm install cypress --save-dev
